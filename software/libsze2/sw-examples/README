These examples demonstrate basic work with NetCOPE libraries.
It is recommended to read doxygen documentation via /usr/share/netcope/sw-examples/doxygen. You can also obtain information using netcope manual pages:
man netcope(1) and man netcope-platform(7).

To compile all examples please run
$ aclocal
$ autoconf
$ ./configure
$ make

Description of individual examples
==================================

Example tool
------------
This tool introduces basic read/write operation of firmware registers. It is recommended to read Quick Start Guide prior modifying the source code. This example does not need any cabling of physical ports.

PCAP
----
This example describes how to use a modified PCAP library to receive or send packets from/to COMBOv2 card. It is recommended to read Users Manual prior modifying the source code. 
Usage: 
1. Connect with a cable physical port 0 and port 1 of COMBOv2 card. 
2. Enable receiving data on interface 1 using: ibufctl -i 1 -e 1
3. Enable transmitting data on interface 0 using: obufctl -i 0 -e 1
4. Open new terminal as root and start ./read and leave it running
5. Open second terminal as root and run ./write
6. You have successfully transferred packets from interface 0 to interface 1.


SZE
---
This example describes how to use a raw access to SZE library to read or write packets from/to COMBOv2 card. It is recommended to read Users Manual prior modifying the source code. 
Usage: 
1. Connect with a cable physical port 0 and port 1 of COMBOv2 card. 
2. Enable receiving data on interface 1 using: ibufctl -i 1 -e 1
3. Enable transmitting data on interface 0 using: obufctl -i 0 -e 1
4. Open new terminal and start ./read and leave it running
5. Open second terminal and run ./write
6. You have successfully transferred packets from interface 0 to interface 1.
